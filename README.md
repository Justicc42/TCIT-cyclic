<<<<<<< HEAD
A program inplemented Taffi component increment theory (TCIT). It used to predict enthalpy of formation

This script predicts the enthalpy of formation for given target compounds based on a fixed TCIT CAV database distributed with the paper "A Self-Consistent Component Increment Theory for Predicting Enthalpy of Formation" by Zhao and Savoie. Further ring correction is added distributed with the paper "Ring correction XXX"' by Zhao, Iovanac and Savoie. The script operates on .xyz files, prints the components that it uses for each prediction, and will return the 0K and 298K enthalpy of formation. No ring corrections are supplied in this version of the script, and compounds that require missing CAVs are skipped.
